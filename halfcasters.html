            <strong>Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence</strong> Artificers are basically magical engineers. They use their intelligence to tinker with and create incredible magic items with the combination of their spellcraft and technological mind. If you need a powerful weapon, fancy armor, or even just a sharp mind to bounce things off of, Artificers are the ones to call.

            <strong>Spellcasting Ability: Wisdom</strong> Rangers are very good at survival, nature checks, and tracking. Most often Rangers will use ranged weapons like longbows, shortbows, and crossbows (hence the name). Rangers are great to have if your adventure is going to lead you over rough terrain or through a dark dismal forest.

            <strong>Spellcasting Ability: Charisma</strong> Paladins are pretty evenly balanced between fighting skills and wielding magic. They derive their magic from the oath they have sworn, whether that be of light, vengeance, or some other oath. Their charisma helps them along as they cast various types of smites and fight by their sword to uphold the oath they have sworn.

          <p>
            <strong>Spellcasting Ability: Charisma</strong> Warlocks derive their power from some sort of deal or bargain with a demonic force. With this great power comes great charisma but also a great price. Whether they have made a deal with a devil or had to bargain with a demon for the lives of their family, Warlocks are given magic by these forces, though, some would say, not enough spell slots to make the bargain worthwhile.
