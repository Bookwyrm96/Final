            <h1>Spellcasters</h1>
            <p>
              The first category of D&D classes that you will want to learn about is Spellcasters. These are the classes that <strong>can</strong> fight with their hands, but are going to be most effective due to their spellwork, whether that is as a healer, a defender, or an attacker. These are going to be the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorceror, and Wizard classes. Go to the Spellcasters page to learn more.

                Wizards are what many think of when they think of spellcasters, but there are many more to choose from!

          <h1>Half Casters</h1>
            <p>
              The second category of classes is that of the Half-Casters. These are the classes that can cast spells, and also have pretty good fighting stats. This list includes the Artificer, Ranger, Paladin, and Warlock classes. Go to our Half-Casters page to learn more.
            </p>
          <h1>Martials</h1>
            <p>
              The third main category is the Martial classes. These are the classes that use their hands, weapons, or sneakery to fight, rather than any magical ability. These include the Barbarian, Figher, Monk, and Rogue classes. Go to our Martials page to learn more.
