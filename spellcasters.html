                <strong>Spellcasting Ability: Charisma</strong> Bards use their spells as well as their charisma to charm and enchant others. (This means that when building a Bard character, you want to emphasize your Charisma stat). This is helpful when you need NPC’s on your side, and/or want to achieve your goals without leaving a mess behind. Every spellcaster has a focus item, and a Bard’s spellcasting uses their instrument of choice, (usually a lyre, lute, flute, violin, or other easily totable instrument) to compose their magic into being.

                <strong>Spellcasting Ability: Wisdom</strong> Clerics are often great healers that are good to have in your party when facing the perils of adventuring. Almost always in the service of some deity, their magic comes from the divine favor of their chosen god or goddess. They channel their deity and the wisdom they are given by them to cast spells of divine judgment or healing.

                <strong>Spellcasting Ability: Wisdom</strong> Druids also use their wisdom to cast their magic, but rather than a deity (though sometimes they will worship nature gods or spirits), their magic comes from their connection to nature. Druid’s often have the ability to shapeshift, or “wildshape”, into other animal forms, and have excellent control over plants and an affinity for speaking with and taming animals.

              <h1 id="header-even">Sorcerer</h1>

                </figure>
                <strong>Spellcasting Ability: Charisma</strong> Sorcerers have access to magic because someone in their ancestry was magical, or gained the favor of a magical being. Rather than being the result of study or connection, Sorcerers simply have magic that flows through their veins. Because of this, it is their natural charisma that helps channel that magic into spells.

              <h1 id="header-odd">Wizard</h1>

                <strong>Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence</strong> Wizards on the other hand can only perform magic as a result of intense study. They use their intelligence to figure out spells and potions and have a keen mind for problem solving. They do usually have the lowest Hit Point Maximum, however, so be careful to keep toward the back of the party and let your magic do the fighting for you.
